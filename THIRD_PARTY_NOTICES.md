# Third-party notices

This file records every piece of third-party code, data or model that jobleft copies, ports or ships.
Rules (from the build rules):

- Copy or port code only from MIT, Apache-2.0 or BSD sources. Add an entry here in the same commit.
- AGPL and GPL code is reference only. Never copy it. Record a reference only when a design was studied closely.
- Data files need their own entry (source, licence, date, attribution text), even when the code that uses them is ours.
- Never ship data under a non-commercial licence (for example CC BY-NC). Keep share-alike data out of the shipped app, or isolate it and say so here.
- An entry names: the source (URL and commit), the licence, the files in this repository that hold the copied or ported work, and what was taken.

## 1. Code ported or copied into jobleft

### 1.1 freehire (MIT)

- Source: https://github.com/strelov1/freehire, commit `e58b1af64414b2dca7d1566d5d0db17f44a82ac2` (2026-09-24). Read-only clone at `vendor/freehire` (not committed).
- Licence: MIT. Copyright (c) 2026 freehire contributors. Full text in section 5.1.
- What was taken: logic only, re-written from Go to TypeScript by the S1 spike (2026-09-24) and moved into this repository by the foundation commit. No Go file, data list, brand mark, image or certificate was copied.

| jobleft file | Ported from (freehire path) | What |
|---|---|---|
| `packages/crawler/src/sources/greenhouse.ts` | `internal/ingest/sources/greenhouse.go` | Greenhouse board API mapping |
| `packages/crawler/src/sources/lever.ts` | `internal/ingest/sources/lever.go` | Lever postings API mapping |
| `packages/crawler/src/sources/ashby.ts` | `internal/ingest/sources/ashby.go` | Ashby job-board API mapping |
| `packages/crawler/src/sources/util.ts` | `internal/ingest/sources/*.go` helpers | `isRemote`, `workplaceTypeMode`, `roundSalaryPart`, `countryFromCode`, the "not in the future" date rule |
| `packages/crawler/src/lifecycle.ts` | `internal/ingest/pipeline/board_scope.go`, `cooldown.go`, `cmd/ingest/main.go` | Close-vanished guards (board coverage proof, sweepable providers, sweep grace, cooldown backoff, empty-feed net) |
| `packages/crawler/src/types.ts` | `internal/ingest/sources` `Source` interface | Adapter contract shape (`fullBoardListing` marker) |
| `packages/parsers/src/html.ts` | `unescapeEncodedHTML` rule | Decode one entity layer only when encoded tags outnumber live tags |

Local additions that are not in freehire (written new): the per-host pacer, the robots.txt parser and check, the never-crawl host list, the mass-close guard (`closeTooBroad`), the empty-streak rule, the level and pay parsers, the US-location heuristic and the SQLite store.

### 1.2 Internship Machine (first party)

- Source: the owner's own Python project (`~/Documents/internships`, `pipeline/normalize.py` and `pipeline/dedup.py`). First-party code, no third-party licence applies.
- jobleft file: `packages/crawler/src/normalize.ts` (URL canonicalisation, company and title normalisers, the two-layer dedupe spine). Two deliberate changes are documented in that file (`gh_jid` is kept; intern words are kept).

### 1.3 Other job sources (`packages/sources-other`)

- No third-party code was copied or ported. The adapters for Remote OK, The Muse, the HN hiring thread, the GitHub job
  lists, Remotive and USAJOBS are written new in TypeScript from each source's public documentation (links in
  `docs/sources/*.md`).
- First-party reference (no third-party licence applies): the owner's Internship Machine
  (`~/Documents/internships/internships/sources/github_repo.py`, `extra_adapters.py`) was read for the list formats,
  the HN header split on `|`, and the USAJOBS headers. No file was copied.
- Fixtures (`packages/sources-other/fixtures/`) hold made-up employers, titles, text and links only. Their structure
  follows one real answer of each source read on 2026-09-25; only that structure (paths and types, no data) is kept,
  in `fixtures/*/shape.json`. The real answers were not committed.
- Data the app reads at run time from these sources stays on the person's laptop and is shown with the credit each
  source's terms ask for: Remote OK ("mention Remote OK as a source", link back), The Muse (link back, terms 3.4), the
  GitHub lists (repository credit; vanshb03 lists are MIT, Copyright (c) their authors; SimplifyJobs and speedyapply
  lists have no licence file and are used for facts only), and Hacker News (link to each comment).

## 2. Data shipped with the app

None yet. The static-data lane adds entries here (board directory, H-1B sponsor table from US Department of Labor LCA disclosure files, city dictionary with its attribution, skill dictionary).

## 3. Development tools (not shipped in the app)

| Package | Version | Licence | Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| typescript | 7.0.2 | Apache-2.0 | Type checking only (`tsc --noEmit`). Platform binaries come as optional dependencies; no install script |
| @types/node | 24.13.6 | MIT | Node 24 type definitions |

## 4. Install scripts that run

None. `pnpm-workspace.yaml` sets `ignoreScripts: true` and an empty `allowBuilds`. A lane that needs a dependency's install script reads it first and records it here: package, version, script, why it is needed.

## 5. Licence texts

### 5.1 MIT licence (freehire)
